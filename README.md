***
This module may be buggy and need some fine tuning. Feel free to let me know what problems you encounter by opening an issue on the repo.
This was originally an update of the original bot from [ruiqimao](https://github.com/ruiqimao/discord.js-music) by [nexu-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-music-v11), but is now a updated version for [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)'s version 11.2^. Fixes deprecated warnings, video playback issues, along with various other add-ons and tweaks to the priors.  

It was then modified from [TheDemise](https://github.com/TheDemise/discord.js-musicbot-addon) to work for r/DestinyTheGame's [Sweeper Bot](https://github.com/r-DestinyTheGame/Sweeper-Bot/) with heavy tuning for specific permissions.

_Note: the 1.3.x+ update(S) requires a code change from 1.2.0, see the examples/notes below._  

__The commands available are: (default names)__  
* `musichelp [command]`: Displays help text for commands by this addon, or help for a specific command.
* `play <url>|<search string>`: Play audio from YouTube.
* `skip [number]`: Skip a song or multi songs with skip [some number],
* `queue`: Display the current queue.
* `pause`: Pause music playback. (requires music manager).
* `resume`: Resume music playback. (requires music manager).
* `volume`: Adjust the playback volume between 1 and 200 (requires music manager).
* `leave`: Clears the song queue and leaves the channel.
* `clearqueue`: Clears the song queue.

__Permissions:__  
* If `anyoneCanSkip` is false then only admins and the user that requested the song can skip it.
* If `anyoneCanAdjust` is true, anyone can adjust the volume. False is only admins.
* If `ownerOverMember` is true, the set ID of the user (your ID) will over-ride CanAjust and CanSkip.

# Installation
***  
__Pre-installation:__  
1. `npm install discord.js`  
It is recommended to have the stable over dev branch.  

2. `ffmpeg installed` and in your PATH.  
Allows the bot to join voice as well as speak.
* Download the ffmpeg package for your system.
* Extract it to the proper place.
* Set it to your PATH environment variables.

3. `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  
Required for voice. Discord _prefers_ node-opus, but it is your choice.

__Installation:__  
* `npm install discord.js-musicbot-addon`

__Common installation issues:__  
__Issue:__ FFMPEG was not found on your system.  
__Fix:__ Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly and set in your PATH variable.  

__Issue:__ Couldn't find an Opus engine.  
__Fix:__ `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  

__Issue:__ [NPM] ERR Cannot read property '0' of undefined  
__Fix:__ `npm i -g npm@4.6.1` or another lower version of npm.  

__Issue:__ TypeError: Invalid non-string/buffer chunk  
__Fix:__ `ffmpeg` is required, if you installed `ffmpeg-binaries` uninstall that and install `ffmpeg`. If that isn't your problem make sure you have it installed correctly.  

__Issue:__ Any node-gyp errors. (build fail, missing cl.exe, etc.)  
__Fix:__ This one is a little more complicated.  
1. Download and install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  
2. New project -> Visual C++  
3. Install Visual C++  

If that doesn't fix your issue;  
1. Download and install the [Windows 8.1 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)  

__Issue:__ `ffluent-ffmpeg` errors.
1. Download and install ffmpeg correctly for your OS.
2. Make sure it's in your PATH/exported.

An example of a few custom options would be:  
```javascript
const music = new Music(client, {
  prefix: ">",
  maxQueueSize: "100",
  disableLoop: true,
  disableClear: true,
  helpCmd: 'mhelp',
  playCmd: 'music',
  leaveCmd: 'begone',
  ownerOverMember: true,
  botOwner: '1234567890',
  youtubeKey: 'some-key_here'
});
```
